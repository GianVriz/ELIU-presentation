Data augmentation in image generation refers to the process of creating new and different variations of images by applying random transformations such as rotation, zooming, flipping, and shifting, to the original images. This technique is useful in increasing the available amount of training data and making the trained model more robust and less overfitting.

In time series data, data augmentation can involve resampling data points, smoothing the data, adding noise, or shifting the time series. It is performed to generate more diverse and complex data to improve the accuracy and generalization of predictive models. Time series data augmentation can also include the creation of new features from existing data, such as computing the rolling average or applying Fourier transformations.
